<h1>Apollo Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#apollo-code-of-conduct" title="永久链接至标题"></a></h1>
<p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.</p>
<section id="our-standards">
<h2>Our Standards<a class="headerlink" href="#our-standards" title="永久链接至标题"></a></h2>
<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Using welcoming and inclusive language.</p></li>
<li><p>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.</p></li>
<li><p>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.</p></li>
<li><p>Focusing on what is best for the community.</p></li>
<li><p>Showing empathy towards other community members.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances.</p></li>
<li><p>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Public or private harassment.</p></li>
<li><p>Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic
address, without explicit permission.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate for the forum in
which it occurs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All Apollo forums and spaces are meant for professional interactions, and any
behavior which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional
setting is unacceptable.</p>
</section>
<section id="our-responsibilities">
<h2>Our Responsibilities<a class="headerlink" href="#our-responsibilities" title="永久链接至标题"></a></h2>
<p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.</p>
</section>
<section id="scope">
<h2>Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#scope" title="永久链接至标题"></a></h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies to all content on apollo.auto, Apollo’s GitHub
organization, or any other official Apollo web presence allowing for community
interactions, as well as at all official Apollo events, whether offline or
online.</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct also applies within project spaces and in public spaces
whenever an individual is representing Apollo or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
or de facto representative at an online or offline event.</p>
</section>
<section id="conflict-resolution">
<h2>Conflict Resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#conflict-resolution" title="永久链接至标题"></a></h2>
<p>Conflicts in an open source project can take many forms, from someone having a
bad day and using harsh and hurtful language in the issue queue, to more serious
instances such as sexist/racist statements or threats of violence, and
everything in between.</p>
<p>If the behavior is threatening or harassing, or for other reasons requires
immediate escalation, please see below.</p>
<p>However, for the vast majority of issues, we aim to empower individuals to first
resolve conflicts themselves, asking for help when needed, and only after that
fails to escalate further. This approach gives people more control over the
outcome of their dispute.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing or witnessing conflict, we ask you to use the following
escalation strategy to address the conflict:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Address the perceived conflict directly with those involved, preferably in a
real-time medium.</p></li>
<li><p>If this fails, get a third party (e.g. a mutual friend, and/or someone with
background on the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intercede.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are still unable to resolve the conflict, and you believe it rises to
harassment or another code of conduct violation, report it.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="reporting-violations">
<h2>Reporting Violations<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting-violations" title="永久链接至标题"></a></h2>
<p>Violations of the Code of Conduct can be reported to the project team at
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:apollo-beijing&#37;&#52;&#48;baidu&#46;com">apollo-beijing<span>&#64;</span>baidu<span>&#46;</span>com</a>. The team will determine whether the Code of Conduct
was violated, and will issue an appropriate sanction, possibly including a
written warning or expulsion from the project, project sponsored spaces, or
project forums. We ask that you make a good-faith effort to resolve your
conflict via the conflict resolution policy before submitting a report.</p>
<p>Violations of the Code of Conduct can occur in any setting, even those unrelated
to the project. We will only consider complaints about conduct that has occurred
within one year of the report.</p>
</section>
<section id="enforcement">
<h2>Enforcement<a class="headerlink" href="#enforcement" title="永久链接至标题"></a></h2>
<p>If the project team receives a report alleging a violation of the Code of
Conduct, it will notify the accused of the report, and provide them an
opportunity to discuss the report before a sanction is issued. The team will do
its utmost to keep the reporter anonymous. If the act is ongoing (such as
someone engaging in harassment), or involves a threat to anyone’s safety (e.g.
threats of violence), the team may issue sanctions without notice.</p>

available at <a class="reference external" href="https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4">https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4</a>, and includes some
