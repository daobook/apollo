"Dreamland is Apollo's web-based simulation platform. Based on an enormous"
" amount of driving scenario data and large-scale cloud computing "
"capacity, Apollo simulation engine creates a powerful testing environment"
" for the development of an autonomous driving system, from algorithms to "
"grading, and then back to improved algorithms. It enables the developers "
"and start-ups to run millions of miles of simulation daily, which "
"dramatically accelerates the development cycle."

"traffic conditions."
