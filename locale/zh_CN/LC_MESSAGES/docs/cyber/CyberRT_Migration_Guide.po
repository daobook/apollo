"This article describes the essential changes for projects to migrate from"
" Apollo ROS (Apollo 3.0 and before) to Apollo Cyber RT (Apollo 3.5 and "
"after). We will be using the very first ROS project talker/listener as "
"example to demonstrate step by step migration instruction."

"ROS use `CMake` as its build system but Cyber RT use `bazel`. In a ROS "
"project, CmakeLists.txt and package.xml are required for defining build "
"configs like build target, dependency, message files and so on. As for a "
"Cyber RT component, a single bazel BUILD file covers. Some key build "
"config mappings are listed below."

"We can find the mapping easily from the 2 file snippets. For example, "

"Apollo ROS has customized to support proto message formate that a "

"projectName_proto(`pb_msgs_example_proto`) in `target_link_libraries` are"
" required to send message in proto formate. For config proto message in "
"Cyber RT, it's as simple as adding the target proto file path "
"concantenated with name of `cc_proto_library` in `deps` setting. The "
"`cc_proto_library` is set up in BUILD file under proto folder."

"The package definition has also changed in Cyber RT. In Apollo ROS a "
