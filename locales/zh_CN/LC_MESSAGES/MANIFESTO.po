"Apollo is an open platform whose primary purpose is to become a vibrant "
"autonomous driving ecosystem by providing a comprehensive, safe, secure, "
"and reliable solution that supports all major features and functions of "
"an autonomous vehicle."

"Apollo's ambition is no less than to revolutionize the auto and "
"transportation industries, and there will be challenges of unprecedented "
"scale and complexity along the way. Given Apollo's enormous potential to "
"change the world, this historic opportunity requires a unique governance "
"model that must support a highly effective leadership which is as "
"inclusive and open as possible in order to swiftly achieve Apollo's "
"vision."

"In order to safeguard the architectural integrity, system reliability, "
"and rapid evolution of Apollo, Baidu is willing to step up and exercise "
"its leadership in driving important decisions whenever needed while "
"preserving active participation of the wider community."

msgid "Apollo Manifesto"

#: ../../MANIFESTO.md:11
msgid ""
"In essence, Apollo is the freedom from wasting time and resources re-"
"implementing fundamental components and allows each member of the "
"ecosystem to focus on their specific areas of expertise, which will "
"dramatically increase the speed of innovation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MANIFESTO.md:13
msgid ""
"Apollo’s comprehensive, modular solution allows anyone to use as much or "
"as little of the existing source code and data. Open source code portions"
" can be modified and open capability components accessible through an API"
" can be replaced with proprietary implementations. All this can then be "
"contributed back to Apollo, redistributed, and commercialized."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MANIFESTO.md:15
msgid ""
"Critical considerations such as ensuring reliability, handling failover, "
"and guaranteeing security that would pose a challenge to most development"
" efforts will be readily available components. Everyone can benefit from "
"Apollo's capabilities to improve individual competitive advantage."

msgid ""
"Apollo provides high quality code and data that allows anyone to "
"bootstrap their autonomous driving development, but only with "
"contributions from Apollo’s partners and the wider community can Apollo "
"become increasingly more capable. The goal is to create a virtuous cycle "
"where software and services are deployed onto the vehicle to obtain "
"quality data, which is then used to create an even more capable "
"autonomous system. Accelerating this iterative cycle is the engine of "
"innovation that will give birth to a viable autonomous vehicle and "
"compelling services leading to a breakthrough autonomous ecosystem."

"Apollo welcomes anyone to make technical and non-technical contributions,"
" but the most valuable contribution is high quality data, it is the very "
"fuel that drives innovation. Baidu will seed Apollo with its vast dataset"
" that the community can experiment with. However, Baidu’s contribution "
"alone is not enough to sustain Apollo’s evolution let alone realize "
"Apollo’s grand ambition. Therefore, Apollo will create an innovative data"
" collective that will pool high quality data from Apollo’s partners, each"
" of whom can leverage a larger data set than it can gather individually."
msgstr ""

#: ../../MANIFESTO.md:21
msgid ""
"This innovative platform and data service creates a lasting, mutually "
"beneficial business model that accelerates individual innovation as well "
"as sustains the growth of a breakthrough ecosystem. On a broader level, "
"Apollo will engage academia, government, and the general public in order "
"to convince and educate society on the acceptance and adoption of "
"autonomous technology. Only by growing the ecosystem together rather than"
" through individual efforts can the full potential of autonomous vehicles"
" and services be realized for the benefit of all."
