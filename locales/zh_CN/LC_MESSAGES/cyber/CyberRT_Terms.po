msgid ""
"In an autonomous driving system, modules(like perception, localization, "
"control systems...) exist in the form of components under Cyber RT. Each "
"component communicates with the others through Cyber channels. The "
"component concept not only decouples modules but also provides the "
"flexibility for modules to be divided into components based individual "
"module design."

msgid "Node"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cyber/CyberRT_Terms.md:20
msgid ""
"Node is the fundamental building block of Cyber RT; every module contains"
" and communicates through the node. A module can have different types of "
"communication by defining read/write and/or service/client in a node."

msgid "Service/Client"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cyber/CyberRT_Terms.md:28
msgid ""
"Besides Reader/writer, Cyber RT also provides service/client pattern for "
"module communication. It supports two-way communication between nodes. A "

msgid "Service discovery"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cyber/CyberRT_Terms.md:36
msgid ""
"As a decentralized design framework, Cyber RT does not have a "
"master/central node for service registration. All nodes are treated "
"equally and can find other service nodes through `service discovery`. "
"`UDP` is used in Service discovery."
