#: ../../cyber/doxy-docs/source/CyberRT_FAQs.md:6
msgid ""
"Apollo's Cyber RT is an open source runtime framework designed "
"specifically for autonomous driving scenarios. Based on a centralized "
"computing model, it is highly optimized for performance, latency, and "
"data throughput"

#: ../../cyber/doxy-docs/source/CyberRT_FAQs.md:12
msgid ""
"During years of development of autonomous driving technologies, we have "
"learned a lot from our previous experience with Apollo. In autonomous "
"driving scenarious, we need an effective centralized computing model, "
"with demands for high performance,  including high concurrency, low "
"latency and high throughput。"

"The industry is evolving, so does Apollo. Going forward, Apollo has "
"already moved from development to productization, with volume deployments"
" in the real world, we see the demands for the highest robustness and "
"high performance. That’s why we spent years of building Apollo Cyber RT, "
"which addresses that requirements of autonomous driving solutions."
