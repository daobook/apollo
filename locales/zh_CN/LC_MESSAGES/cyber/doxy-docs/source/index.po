"Apollo Cyber RT is an open source, high performance runtime framework "
"designed specifically for autonomous driving scenarios. Based on a "
"centralized computing model, it is greatly optimized for high "
"concurrency, low latency, and high throughput in autonomous driving."

"During the last few years of the development of autonomous driving "
"technologies, we have learned a lot from our previous experience with "
"Apollo. The industry is evolving and so is Apollo. Going forward, Apollo "
"has already moved from development to productization, with volume "
"deployments in the real world, we see the demands for the highest level "
"of robustness and performance. Thatâ€™s why we spent years building and "
"perfecting Apollo Cyber RT, which addresses that requirements of "
"autonomous driving solutions."
