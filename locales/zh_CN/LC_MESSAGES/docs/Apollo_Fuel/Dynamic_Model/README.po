"Vehicle dynamic modeling service employs the supervised machine learning "
"algorithm to generate a learning-based vehicle dynamic model, which can "
"be used as the customized dynamic model in the Apollo simulation platform"
" for control-in-the-loop simulation. The usage of the dynamic modeling "
"asks for three main steps: (1) collect the training/test data for "
"learning-based modeling, via a frontend data collection process "
"monitoring system, (2) upload the collected data into cloud by locally "
"build the standard BOS-linked folder, and (3) submit the service command "
"via the online service webpage and expect the modeling results within "
"email notice."
