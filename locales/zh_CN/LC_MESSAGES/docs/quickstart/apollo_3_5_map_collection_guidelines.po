"In Apollo 2.5, map creation services became a part of Apollo Open Source "
"project. To acquire the data necessary for map creation, one would need "
"to install an additional VLP-16 LiDAR on the vehicle. The purpose of this"
" LiDAR is to collect point cloud information for objects above the FOV of"
" the HDL-64 S3 LiDAR, such as traffic lights and signs. It requires a "
"customized rack to mount the VLP-16 Lidar on top of the vehicle. The "
"figure below shows one of the possible configurations: "

"In this specific configuration, the VLP-16 LiDAR is mounted with an "
"upward tilt of **20±2°**. The power cable of the VLP-16 is connected to "
"the DataSpeed power panel. The ethernet connection is connected to the "
"IPC (possibly through an ethernet switch). Similar to HDL-64 S3 LiDAR, "
"the VLP-16 GPRMC and PPS receive input from the GPS receiver. Ideally, "
"additional hardware should be installed to duplicate the GPRMC and PPS "
"signal from the GPS receiver sent to HDL-64 and VLP-16 respectively. "
"However, a simple Y-split cable may also provide adequate signal for both"
" LiDARs. To distinguish from the HDL-64 S3 LiDAR, please follow the "
"VLP-16 manual and configure the IP of VLP-16 to **192.168.20.14**, the "
"data port to **2369**, and the telemetry port to **8309**. The pinout for"
" the signal input from GPS receiver can also be found in the manual if "
"you need customized cable."
