"Apollo 3.5 uses several information sources to plan a safe and collision "

" module. As Apollo matures and takes on different road conditions and "
"driving use cases, planning has evolved to a more modular, scenario "
"specific and wholistic approach. In this approach, each driving use case "
"is treated as a different driving scenario. This is useful because an "
"issue now reported in a particular scenario can be fixed without "
"affecting the working of other scenarios as opposed to the previous "
"versions, wherein an issue fix affected other driving use cases as they "
"were all treated as a single driving scenario."
