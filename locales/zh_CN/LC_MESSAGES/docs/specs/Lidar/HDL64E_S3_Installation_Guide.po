"A customized mounting structure is required to successfully mount an "
"HDL64E S3 LiDAR on top of a vehicle. This structure must provide rigid "
"support to the LiDAR system while raising the LiDAR to a certain height "
"above the ground under driving conditions. This mounted height should "
"prevent the laser beams from the LiDAR being blocked by the front and/or "
"rear of the vehicle. The actual height needed for the LiDAR depends on "
"the design of the vehicle and the mounting point of the LiDAR is relative"
" to the vehicle being used. The vertical tilt angle of the lasers "
"normally ranges from **+2~-24.8 degrees relative to the horizon**.  For a"
" standard Lincoln MKZ, it is recommended that you mount the LiDAR at a "
"minimum height of 1.8 meters (from ground to the base of the LiDAR), to "
"use the angle range for detection effectively."
