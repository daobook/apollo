"A customized mounting structure(s) is required to successfully mount a "
"Puck Series LiDAR on top of a vehicle. This structure must provide rigid "
"support to the LiDAR system. If only one LiDAR is used in the system, the"
" mount needs to raise the LiDAR to a certain height to avoid the laser "
"beams being blocked by the vehicle's body. If multiple LiDAR's are to be "
"installed, the mounting structure(s) needs to provide suitable LiDAR "
"configurations including positioning and tilting of the LiDARs as "
"required by your system. Please find the detailed tilt angle of each "
"laser beam on the individual LiDAR's manual when deciding the mounting of"
" the LiDARs. Or you could also consult with Apollo engineers for the "
"configurations that we have used and tested successfully."

"In Apollo 2.5, map creation service has been made available. To acquire "

"additional VLP-16 LiDAR on the vehicle. The purpose of this LiDAR is to "
"collect point cloud information for objects above the FOV of the HDL-64 "

" to mount the VLP-16 LiDAR on top of the vehicle. The figure below shows "

"In this specific configuration, the VLP-16 LiDAR is mounted with an "
"upward tilt of 20±2°. The power cable of the VLP-16 is connected to the "
"DataSpeed power panel. The ethernet connection is connected to the IPC "
"(possibly through an ethernet switch). Similar to HDL-64E S3 LiDAR, the "
"VLP-16's GPRMC and PPS receive input from the same GPS receiver. Ideally,"
" additional hardware should be installed to duplicate the GPRMC and PPS "
"signals from the GPS receiver and sent to HDL-64 and VLP-16 respectively."
" However, a simple Y-split cable may also provide adequate signal for "
"both LiDARs. To help distinguish from the HDL-64 S3 LiDAR, please follow "
"the VLP-16 manual and use the webpage interface to configure the IP of "
"VLP-16 to **192.168.20.14**, its data port to **2369**, and its telemetry"
" port to **8309**. The pinout for the signal input from GPS receiver can "
"also be found in the manual if you need customized cable. Please connect "
"the VLP-16 to the same network as the HDL-64E and configure the ethernet "
"switch to do port forwarding."
