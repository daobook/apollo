"Bridge is responsible for forwarding the proto message specified in "
"Apollo to the external module in UDP mode, and receiving the proto "
"message from the external module. Due to the limitation of the UDP packet"
" (the maximum packet size is 65535 bytes), the proto message exceeds this"
" limit after serialization. It is possible, so the serialized packets "
"need to be fragmented, and each slice is called a frame. The receiver "
"receives all the frames and then combines and deserializes them. In order"
" to conveniently distinguish each frame of data, to facilitate subsequent"
" combination and deserialization, it is necessary to add frame header "
"information at the head of each frame of data, as shown in the following "
"figure:"
