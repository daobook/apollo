"Simulation is a vital part of autonomous driving especially in Apollo "
"where most of the testing happens via our simulation platform. In order "
"to have a more accurate approach to our testing environment, Apollo 5.0 "
"introduces Dynamic model which is used to achieve Control-in-loop "
"Simulation to represent the ego car's actual dynamic characteristics. It "
"is possible to gauge the how the ego car would actually perform while "
"driving in autonomous mode, but virtually using the Control-in-loop "
"simulation making it secure and efficient. It can also accelerate your "
"development cycle as you can maximize your testing and enhance your "
"algorithms even before entering the vehicle."

"![](images/architecture.png) The Control module receives input via "
"planning and the vehicle and uses it effectively to generate the output "
"path which is then fed into the Dynamic model."

"**Lateral Control** The ego car has to make a wide-angle U-turn in this "
"scenario. As seen in the image below, the steering turn is at 64%. You "
"can also monitor the performance of the dynamic model on the right "
"against the actual planned trajectory."

"**Backward Behavior** The ego car has to park itself in a designated "
"spot. This scenario is complex as it requires a mixture of forward and "
"backward (reverse) driving and requires a high level of accuracy from the"
" control module. As you can see in the image below, the steering turn "
"required is at `-92%`. Additional details on this example can be seen in "
"the planning module's Park scenario."
