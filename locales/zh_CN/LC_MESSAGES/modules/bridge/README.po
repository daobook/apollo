"The startup of Bridge is consistent with the startup of other modules. "
"Bridge contains two sub-modules, other than: sender and receiver. The "
"sender is responsible for sending the udp data, and the receiver is "
"responsible for receiving the data packet sent by the udp client, and "
"parsing it, and then sending it to the module that has registered to "
"respond to the message. The start command of Sender is as follows."
