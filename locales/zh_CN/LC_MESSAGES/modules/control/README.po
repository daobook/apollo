"Based on the planning trajectory and the car's current status, the "
"Control module uses different control algorithms to generate a "
"comfortable driving experience. The Control module can work both in "
"normal and navigation modes."

#: ../../modules/control/README.md:7
msgid ""
"**Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC)**: This new algorithm is "
"designed to effectively offset the by-wire steering dynamic delay and "
"time latency. It also ensures faster and more accurate steering control "
"actions for tracking the planning trajectory. With MRAC, Apollo 5.5 "
"Control now supports fast and sharp turning scenarios like successive "
"side-pass."

"**Control Profiling Service**: This service provides a systematic "
"quantitative analysis of the vehicle's control performance based on road-"
"tests or simulation data. The Profiling service not only helps support "
"the high-efficiency iterative design cycle of the vehicle's control "
"systems but also provides users with insights into the current "
"performance and improvements seen within the module."
