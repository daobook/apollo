"The goal of multi-sensor localization is to provide a robust method which"
" can achieve high localization accuracy and resilience in challenging "
"scenes, such as urban downtown, highways, and tunnels. It adaptively uses"
" information from complementary sensors such as GNSS, LiDAR and IMU. If "
"you want to know more details, please refer to our paper   *Guowei Wan, "
