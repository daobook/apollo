"Lidar perception module receives messages from lidar driver, processes "
"them with detection and tracking algorithms as well as output tracked "
"cuboid-shape obstacles. In detail, Apollo uses PointPillars model as the "
"detection algorithm to detect obstacles and classify them as cars, buses,"
" trucks, pedestrians, etc. Next, the tracking algorithm tracks these "
"obstacles according to detection results from preceding frames. At the "
"end of lidar perception module, tracked obstacles are sent to fusion "
"component to get fusion with obstacles from other components such as "
"camera and radar components."

"Lidar perception module utilizes "
"[PointPillars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05784) as the main detection "
"method. PointPillars model only takes point cloud as input, without "
"images or other sensor data. It consists of 2 stages. The first stage is "
"the pillar feature extractor (PFE) which extracts feature from pillars "
"that are grid representations of the point cloud from bird's eye view "
"(BEV). After PFE layers, point cloud is transformed into 2D feature maps."
" Taking these BEV pseudo-images, the second stage, region proposal "
"network (RPN), which is mainly composed of convolution layers generates "
"bounding boxes and classification labels of obstacles."
