"The Prediction module studies and predicts the behavior of all the "
"obstacles detected by the perception module. Prediction receives obstacle"
" data along with basic perception information including positions, "
"headings, velocities, accelerations, and then generates predicted "
"trajectories with probabilities for those obstacles."

"In **Apollo 5.5**, the Prediction module introduces a new model - "
"**Caution Obstacle**. Together with aggressively emphasizing on caution "
"when proceeding to a junction, this model will now scan all obstacles "
"that have entered the junction as long as computing resources permit. The"
" Semantic LSTM Evaluator and the Extrapolation Predictor have also been "
"introduced in Apolo 5.5 to support the Caution Obstacle model."

"Based on the figure below, the prediction module comprises 4 main "

"Container, Evaluator and Predictor existed in Apollo 3.0. In Apollo 3.5, "

"scenario-based approach for Apollo's autonomous driving capabilities. "
