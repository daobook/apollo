"Storytelling is a global and high-level Scenario Manager to help "
"coordinate cross-module actions. In order to safely operate the "
"autonomous vehicle on urban roads, complex planning scenarios are needed "
"to ensure safe driving. These complex scenarios may involve different "
"modules to ensure proper maneuvering. In order to avoid a sequential "
"based approach to such scenarios, a new isolated scenario manager, the "
"\"Storytelling\" module was created. This module creates stories which "
"are complex scenarios that would trigger multiple modules' actions. Per "
"some predefined rules, this module creates ne or multiple stories and "
"publishes to `/apollo/storytelling` channel. The main advantage of this "
"module is to fine tune the driving experience and also isolate complex "
"scenarios packaging them into stories that can be subscribed to by other "
"modules like Planning, Control etc."
