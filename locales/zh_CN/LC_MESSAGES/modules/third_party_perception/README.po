"In Apollo 2.5, the third_party_perception module incorporates third-party"
" sensors like Mobileye and Conti/Delphi Radar output with simple fusion "
"and creates a similar perception output produced as obstacle/lane "
"detection information as defined in [Perception Obstacles "
"Interface](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/perception/proto/perception_obstacle.proto)."
" This module was only intend to serve for the Prediction/Planning/Control"
" algorithm in real vehicle before perception modules fully ready before "
"2.5. We recommend using 'modules/perception' instead for your own test "
"purpose after Apollo 2.5 officially released."
