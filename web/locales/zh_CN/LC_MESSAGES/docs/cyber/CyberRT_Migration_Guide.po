"This article describes the essential changes for projects to migrate from"
" Apollo ROS (Apollo 3.0 and before) to Apollo Cyber RT (Apollo 3.5 and "
"after). We will be using the very first ROS project talker/listener as "
"example to demonstrate step by step migration instruction."

"ROS use `CMake` as its build system but Cyber RT use `bazel`. In a ROS "
"project, CmakeLists.txt and package.xml are required for defining build "
"configs like build target, dependency, message files and so on. As for a "
"Cyber RT component, a single bazel BUILD file covers. Some key build "
"config mappings are listed below."
