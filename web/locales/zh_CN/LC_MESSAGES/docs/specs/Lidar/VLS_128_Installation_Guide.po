"A customized mounting structure is required to successfully mount an "
"VLS-128 LiDAR on top of a vehicle. This structure must provide rigid "
"support to the LiDAR system while raising the LiDAR to a certain height "
"above the ground under driving conditions. This mounted height should "
"prevent the laser beams from the LiDAR being blocked by the front and/or "
"rear of the vehicle. The actual height needed for the LiDAR depends on "
"the design of the vehicle and the mounting point of the LiDAR is relative"
" to the vehicle being used. The LiDAR must be mounted straight without "
"tilting.  For a standard Lincoln MKZ, it is recommended that you mount "
"the LiDAR at a minimum height of **1.8 meters** (from ground to the base "
"of the LiDAR), to use the angle range for detection effectively."
