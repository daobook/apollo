"As the Planning module introduced a major change with the launch of "
"Scenario-based planning, we realized the need to have scenario specific "
"algorithms that can be fine-tuned to enhance the trajectory of the ego-"
"car for that particular scenario. The Open Space Planner is one such "
"algorithm in development targeted towards reverse parking and sharp "
"U-turns. This algorithm was initially inspired by several "
"papers<cite>[1]</cite><cite>[2]</cite><cite>[3]</cite>."

"The received raw trajectory is taken as an initial guess for optimization"
" to iterate on. The generated result is a set of points that are not "
"distributed evenly but are closer to each other near the turning while "
"those on a linear path are more spread-out. This not only ensures better "
"turns, but as time/space is fixed, the nearer the points, the slower the "
"speed of the ego-car. Which also means that velocity tracking in this "
"step is possible but more reasonable acceleration, braking and steering."

"As the algorithm is currently in development, it is currently used for "
"reverse and/or parallel parking, but can also be implemented in scenarios"
" that involve tight U-turns or for curb-side parking when an emergency "
"vehicle passes by. The main aim of scenario-based planning is to ensure "
"efficient planning of the car's trajectory using targeted algorithms for "
"individual scenarios just like with Open Space Planning for reverse "
"parking."
