"A mechanical mount needs to be designed to mount the Radar to the desired"
" position. The mount should be able to hold the Radar in a way that the "
"scanning plane is parallel to the bottom of the car, so that the scanning"
" radar wave would not be blocked by the road surface causing it to create"
" ghost objects. If a stationary mount cannot satisfy such requirement, "
"please consider adding adjustment in vertical and horizontal directions "
"to the mount"
