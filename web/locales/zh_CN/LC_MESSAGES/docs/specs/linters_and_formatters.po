"A great project is made out of consistent code. In the ideal world, you "
"should not be able to tell who wrote a certain line of the code for the "
"project. Modern linters and formatters help to close this gap by "
"specifying a simple set of rules to be enforced on all developers working"
" on the project. Such tools also stimulate developers to write better "
"code by pointing out common mistakes and introducing good programming "
"practices."
