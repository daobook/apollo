"When the autonomous car is running without any driver, it is paramount to"
" add the extra layer of safety by providing teleoperation or remote "
"control ability between the autonomous car and the control center staffed"
" with well-trained teleoperators. Passengers in the autonomous car may "
"need to communicate with the teleoperator about urgent situations. Safety"
" operator also needs to have a full picture of the traffic situation the "
"autonomous car is in before one can make the best decision. Therefore we "
"will need at least some audio and video streaming functionalities. When "
"the teleoperator chooses one of the emergency actions such as \"pull-"
"over\", the autonomous car also needs to respond with appropriate motion "
"planning. We will also need to monitor network sigal strength as it "
"involves remote data transmission."

"Dreamview module tries to provide a web interface that helps to operate "

"interfaces."
